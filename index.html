        <p>
         I would like to gratefully acknowledge my deepest gratitude and contributions to our clinical and industry mentors, Dr Alvin Lee from Department of Urology, Singapore General Hospital, and Mr Peter Cheng from ZIG Ventures, for their invaluable guidance and support in the past semester. Their expertise in medicine and medical technology has directed me to think critically in my approach towards the  medical problem and pinpoint its underlying cause. Along with my team of medical fellow Danny Lo and business fellow Zhang Zhao (Joyce), we have interviewed patients and medical staff over the course of this semester in order to understand the situation, distill our findings to pinpoint the key problem which will be shared in this report.

        <h3>1.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
        Kidney stones are formed when urine becomes supersaturated with stone-forming minerals such as calcium, oxalate and uric acid. These minerals precipitate and form crystals that aggregate and grow within the kidney [1]. Poor dietary habits, lifestyle and genetics contribute to the formation of such stones [2], which can become a serious problem if they fall into the ureter and obstruct the urinary tract leading to symptoms such as back pain, blood in urine and even urinary tract infection [1]. Left untreated, it can lead to serious complications like kidney damage or even kidney infection [3]. Globally, 12% of the population will develop kidney stones, and in Singapore about 1 out of every 10 people will get a kidney stone at some point in their life [2]. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-3-header-2">
        <h3>1.2 Problem Clarification </h3>
        <p>
        Kidney stone sizes can vary. Generally, small stones around 4mm-6mm have a 60% chance of being passed out naturally with medication and water consumption [4]. However, larger stones would require surgical intervention in order to have it removed from the body [5]. For stones under 20mm, Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery paired with Flexible and Navigable Suction Ureteral Access Sheath (RIRS FANS) is the preferred surgical procedure in Singapore as it is non-invasive and improves the stone free rates, without increasing postoperative complications or negatively impacting recovery [6]. For stones greater than 20mm, RIRS FANS is ineffective due to limited visualisation arising from the snow globe effect when carrying out lasering or dusting of the stone into fragments, and the persistence of fragments that cannot be removed [7]. The proportion of kidney stones being larger than 20mm is around 14.5% found in clinical studies[8].
        </p>
       
         <image-component 
            tag="image" 
            subtitle="Figure 1: RIRS FANS Medical Device"
            source="assets/RIRS_FANS_Medical_Device.png"
        ></image-component> 


        <p>
        During the RIRS FANS surgery, a 4mm diameter (12Fr) sheath connected to the suction machine and a thin flexible scope of around 3mm (9 Fr) with camera and irrigation channel found within is inserted into the ureter. The kidney is irrigated with saline solution to expand its cavity which enables the camera to capture and relay a live view of the kidney. With the guidance of X-ray scans, the surgeon searches for the kidney stone. During the surgery, irrigation flushes the bacteria found in the concentrated urine back into the bloodstream which presents a risk of infection. Hence the surgery is limited to a 90-minute long duration as it is the maximum duration and amount of pressure the kidney can be safely exposed to. 
        </p>
        <p>
        During the 90-minute procedure, 30 minutes collectively is spent on breaking the stones down into fragments using a holmium laser on short pulse and high energy settings [9], while the remaining 60 minutes is collectively spent on retrieving the fragments. During fragment retrieval, the surgeon searches for it with the aid of the camera. He needs to establish contact between the scope and surface of the fragment and then withdraw the scope outwards to remove it. Going too fast and the fragment loses contact resulting in redoing the whole process. Going too slow it may exceed the 60 minutes limit which places the irrigated kidney at a higher risk for sepsis. By the end of the surgery, surgeons must strive to meet the minimum 90% SFR that is the current gold standard since the presence of residual fragments larger than 4mm can act as a nidus for future kidney stone formation. This results in a relapse in kidney stone formation [10]. 
        </p>
        <p>  
        Studies have shown that the incidence of developing kidney stones increases with age, with men having a higher likelihood owing to physiological changes in the kidney function [11]. With Singapore’s aging population, it is likely to see an increase in kidney stone occurrence and related treatment procedures. This underscores the importance of addressing the growing challenges and inefficiencies associated with kidney stone extractions.

        <h3>2.1. Stakeholder Analysis </h3>
        <p>
        We interviewed patients and Endourologists from local hospitals. The general patient consensus was that there were no major pain points. From the point of diagnosis to undergoing kidney stone removal surgery and post operative recovery, everything was smooth sailing. However, we noticed a recurring pain point highlighted by the majority of the surgeons are identified in table 1.

        <h2> 3.0 Value Proposition </h2>
        <p>
        Endourologists have difficulty extracting the fragments after lasering the stones. This is because of the inconsistency where the fragments may fall off from the scope, where multiple attempts are needed for every cycle to retrieve a single fragment out. This contributes to arm fatigue as there is an enormous amount of fragments to be extracted out within the 90-minute procedure. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Our urology innovation aims to ease the retrieval process of fragments in terms of the quantity of fragments and time spent to collect within a single cycle. This would enable the endourologists to tackle stones larger than 20mm, as there will naturally be more fragments to retrieve post lasering, within the same 90 minute time frame using the RIRS FANS method.

        <h3> 5.1 Concept Generation </h3>
        <p>
        We ideated using the Scamper tool to develop 5 concepts whose feasibility will be evaluated in subsequent sections. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Concept 1
        </p>
        <p>
        An umbrella-like contraption that is able to open distal to the kidney fragments (represented by the orange circles) and bring multiple stone fragments out per cycle. 
        </p>

        <image-component

        ></image-component> 

        <p>
        Concept 2
        </p>
        <p>
        The left side of figure 5 shows the diameter size being consistent in sheaths used currently. For the second concept (referencing to the right side of figure 5) a single sheath with 2 sections of different diameters. As the sheath goes along from the ureter into the bladder, the diameter gradually increases as there is more space in the bladder. This would possibly provide more working space involved in fragment retrieval.
        </p>

        <image-component 
            tag="image" 
            subtitle="Figure 5: Dual Diameter Sheath"
            source="assets/Dual_Diameter_Sheath.png"
        ></image-component> 

        <p>
        Concept 3
        </p>
        <p>
        Instead of the back of forth arm motion involved in fragment retrieval, a circular core provides circular motion for coiling the sheath up. The larger the circular core, the number of rotations to coil the sheath is reduced and hence arm motion can be managed. 
        </p>

        <image-component 
            tag="image" 
            subtitle="Figure 6: Circular Core Coil"
            source="assets/Circular_Core_Coil_Concept.png"
        ></image-component> 

        <p>
        Concept 4
        </p>
        <p>
        Instead of the irritation channel being found in the scope with the camera, we have shifted the irrigation channel to be along the entire scope. Irrigation will be delivered through the walls to create a continuous flow of fluid that moves the stones. This could achieve a more consistent force in retrieving the fragments and reduce the likelihood of fragments falling off. 
        </p>

        ></image-component> 

        <p>
        Concept 5
        </p>
        <p>
        A method to line the fragments up right in front of the suction and then draw the fragments into the sheath swiftly, thereby increasing the number of fragments retrieved per cycle. 
        </p>

        <p>
        How do we keep the irrigation force consistent along the sheath? 
        </p>
        <p>
        How does the change in irrigation channel placement affect the suction force and hence the negative pressure created?

        <div id="sub-section-8-header-1">
        <h3> 6.1 Prototyping Plan </h3>
        <p>
        We  have acquired a 3D printed kidney model made of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), with the goal of gaining a better visualisation of the kidney anatomy. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We have divided our prototyping plan into 3 key phases with two areas of focus namely the ‘Testing Environment’ and ‘Prototyping Objective’. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Phase 1 - Scaled up dimensions (X10) of prototype concepts 1, 2 and 4. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We have identified concepts 1, 2 and 4 consistently scoring well against our two concept screening matrix, hence we plan to develop them in the prototyping phase.
        </p>
        <p>
        Concept 1
        </p>
        <p>
        Prototyping Objective:
        </p>
        <p>
        For a low fidelity prototype of the umbrella capture concept, we have three different variations of how the canopy designs can be explored, reflected in figure 9. The first design would involve the use of a coffee stirrer spoon to act as the umbrella canopy. The second design would be the use of a wire loop to form a closed loop with cross sections. The third design would be the use of a balloon to be stimulated using a foley catheter. 
        </p>

        ></image-component> 


        <p>
        Testing Environment:
        </p>
        <p>
        We will seal the distal end of the rubber tube (acts as the sheath) that contains the umbrella design. It will be submerged in a tank of water with 4mm limestone fragments placed at the end. The umbrella will be pulled through the tube to observe how it interacts with the surrounding fluid and fragments, as illustrated in figure 10.
        </p>
        <p>
        The aim is to see which umbrella canopy design under the Umbrella Concept can extract fragments out quickly and get answers to our key challenges as identified in section 5.3. 
        </p>

        Concept 2
        </p>
        <p>
        Prototyping Objective: 
        </p>
        <p>
        We will connect a 5cm diameter rubber tube (green tube) to a 10cm diameter rubber tube (red tube). This would recreate the structure of the dual diameter sheath as it passes from the ureter into the urethra, seen on the left side of figure 11. 
        <p>
        Testing Environment: 
        </p>
        <p>
        We received from our Clinical Mentor a RIRS FANS medical device (refer to figure 1) where we intend to observe its navigation through this sheath of varying diameter, as well as exploring to see the feasibility of fragments falling out of the tube once the scope reaches the urethra as this would reduce the distance the surgeon’s arm has to travel to fully retrieve a single fragment.    
        </p>

        <p>
        Concept 4
        </p>
        <p>
        Prototyping Objective : 
        </p>
        <p>
        We have 3 variations of pore placements in the Porous Irrigation Concept, seen in figure 12. We want to understand how the different pore placements and quantity impacts pressure distribution throughout the kidney, ultimately influencing fragment retrieval speed and quantity. 
        </p>

        ></image-component> 

        <p>
        Testing Environment: 
        </p>
        <p>
        Connect the distal end of the rubber tube to a water tank (acts as the inflated kidney) and the proximal end of the tube to the oral irrigator (supplies suction force). Pores will be irrigated by connecting it to a tank and coloured dye will be added into the water to visualise the flow. 4cm limestone fragments will be placed within the tube to stimulate fragment removal. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Phase 2 - Fine Tuning of our scaled up prototype
        </p>
        <p>
        Prototyping Objective: 
        </p>
        <p>
        After phase 1,  we would have assessed the performance of each concept in its effectiveness in retrieving fragments per cycle. In the second phase, we want to get our Clinical Mentor’s feedback to see how else we should adapt the existing features better to his surgical needs. We plan to fine tune our prototype here and further develop our testing environment.
        </p>
        <p>
        Testing Environment Plans: 
        </p>
        <p>
        Use of an oral irrigator to mimic the suction channel of RIRS FANS, and a water tank as a source for irrigation. We want to strive to meet real time irrigation pressure that ranges from 127-151mmhg, and real time suction pressure ranges from -113mmhg and above (refer to appendix C) which can be monitored using a flow sensor and pressure sensor.
        </p>
        <p>
        Three 1 metre long rubber tubes of diameters 0.3cm, 0.5cm and 1cm , would portray the RIRS FANS sheath, ureter and urethra respectively. The set up will be placed at ground level which is similar to that of a patient lying down on the surgical bed while undergoing the surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
        As the majority of kidney stone compositions are of calcium oxide, using limestones would be an ideal choice as it can mimic the chemical compositions, jagged edges and appearance of a real kidney stone.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Phase 3 - Real life model
        </p>
        <p>
        Prototyping Plans: 
        </p>
        <p>
        At the last phase, our prototype design and working mechanisms should be almost near ready for smooth operations. We will want to scale it down to its true size (or scale it down to near its true size) and acquire a pig kidney that is similar in nature to that of a human kidney to test it out.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Testing Environment Plans: 
        </p>
        <p>
        Purchase a pig kidney and insert the RIRS FANS sheath, irrigation and suction channels.  
        </p>
